# @vibld/web

The Vibld builder shell: a React + TypeScript + Vite single-page application
(ADR-0005, ADR-0008) that drives a full generation lifecycle in the browser.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @vibld/web dev        # http://localhost:5173
pnpm --filter @vibld/web build
pnpm --filter @vibld/web typecheck
pnpm --filter @vibld/web test
```

## What this slice does

`prompt → planning → staged files → validation → accepted checkpoint → preview`

The orchestration is `@vibld/core`'s, not a reimplementation: the shell wires a
`FakeModelProvider` into a `DurableGenerationRunner` over an
`InMemoryGenerationStore`, validates the staged snapshot, promotes the
checkpoint by compare-and-set and meters the run with `RunBudgetLedger`. To show
lifecycle progress without adding an event bus to core, `src/generation/observers.ts`
decorates the `GenerationStore` and `ModelProvider` contracts the runner already
depends on.

`BuilderSession` (`src/generation/session.ts`) is a framework-free controller;
React binds to it with `useSyncExternalStore`. An epoch guard means a run
abandoned by "Start over" or by a repeated submission can never write its result
into newer state.

## What this slice does not do

- **The preview is a local mock.** It is static HTML assembled from the accepted
  plan and the generated stylesheet, rendered in a fully restricted iframe
  (`sandbox=""`). Nothing installs dependencies and no generated code runs.
  Sandbox execution (ADR-0004) is not implemented.
- **There is no model provider.** Plans come from a deterministic local
  function so CI needs no credentials (ADR-0007).
- **Console and Problems are placeholders** beyond the lifecycle log and
  validation findings. Process output and build diagnostics arrive with sandbox
  execution.
- No authentication, durable persistence, Git export or deployment.

## Generated output

Generated projects are conventional and portable (ADR-0002): React, TypeScript
and Vite with ordinary `dev`, `build`, `lint` and `typecheck` scripts, and no
Vibld runtime dependency.
